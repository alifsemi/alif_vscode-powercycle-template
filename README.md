# E1C/B1 Power_Cycle_demo
This software example will demonstrate the Alif MCU's ability to quickly cycle between GO and STOP power modes. Maximizing time spent in STOP mode and minimizing time spent transitioning between GO and STOP modes is key to achieving days and weeks of battery life. Using the configurations from this project, you can expect 1 millisecond from wake event to M55-HE reset handler. For now, this project is only tested to work for Ensemble E1C and Balletto B1 devices. To begin, refer to the [Getting Started Guide](doc/getting_started.md) for instructions to run the demo.
